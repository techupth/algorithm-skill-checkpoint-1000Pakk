/* 
What is the Big O notation for Function findProductPrice. Explain your reason.
Answer: the Big O of this function is O(Log n) because the times this function working is depends on the length of array like
Function findStudentById but the differant is if I have more length in array the time complexity not increase equal in Function findStudentById
because working by if it dont find the result you want it will compare the result you want and result it get of that loop and then it will cut
the half of it.The reason make this function not checking every object in array.

/*
